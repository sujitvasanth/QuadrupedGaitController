hi the locations of the files in your root directory should be something like

C:/Documents and Settings/USER/Documents/mywebotsproject/mywebotsproject/worlds/robot5.7.wbt
C:/Documents and Settings/USER/Documents/mywebotsproject/mywebotsproject/controllers/forwardedcontroller/forwardedcontroller.py

open the wbt file in webots 2020b1
ensure the controller is registered properly within the webots interfaceif not already
and tools >>preference >> general >> python command shoudl point to your python2.7 command

I did write a detailed instruction guide on how to get the controller running - I will try and find this
